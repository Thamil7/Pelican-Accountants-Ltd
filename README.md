### Typography:
I imported main fonts from [Google font] ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato&family=Staatliches&display=swap)

## Testing:

I have tested the webpage using Google chrome and edge. Also I tested on difference devices such as on my phone and ipad.

I had to go back everytime to change the background size, image size, margin of text and images,etc.
Encountered the following issues:
1) When designing circle image in the middle of the home page i had the wrong height and width.
- Solution: i tried different size of pixels and managed to get the image in the middle of circle.
2) Responsive elements: i had major issue with our services and footer content moving around when i view my webpage in phone.
-Solution: with the help of mentor and mostly Googled and watched videos to gain further knowledge about how this works. I managed to input the correct height, width, margin, line height, etc.
3) Creating form: It was really difficult to understand the concept first. In the conact us form i have decided to do transition of colors when submitting the form, i missed couple of elements, hence the contact us form didn't allow me to see how I wanted the submit button to look.
 - Solution: After alot of research and using the resources from code institute i managed to add appropriate elements.
4) Thank you page: Same as above i wasn't sure how to begin with the page.
- Solution: With the help of Google (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_rel.asp) and other resources I managed to create a thank you page.
Aprt from the above issues I had to deal with other minor issues such as, positioning of images and text which i managed to change and created how i wanted the overall webpage to look.
